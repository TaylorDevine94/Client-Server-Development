How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write programs that are maintable, readable, and adaptable is by using best coding practices by using comments, proper indents, descriptive variable names, and clean coding practices. This makes the code maintable by being able to add on or reuse the code for further projects. The CRUD module was used for the project one but could be added to project to by being adaptable to other projects. By adding the update and delete method we were able to use the same code for future projects. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

To apporach the problems as a computer scientist is analysing the problems with clear critical thinking pattern. By establishing a guide of how to approach these problems you find different ways to find solutions. By approaching the requirements for Grazioso Salvare is by gathering all requirements from the client and understanding what the clients needs are. From there you can program the database to meet these requirements for the client and ensuring that the program meets all expectations. The techniques to be used in future database projects is by programming a clean and organized database to easily be accessable from other users. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
